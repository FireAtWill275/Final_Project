This is an example wireframe for the 1st milestone of the final project.
 
While browsing through http://gallery.ga.co, I came across a site a FEWD-student had built for the band, Weepinâ€™ Willows.  

http://www.weepinwillows.com/

I went ahead and reverse-engineered an example wireframe for it - as if I were the student handing in the wireframe for Milestone 1.  

This is an example of what we will be looking for, as it conveys:

- the topic/idea the student is interested in focusing on
- enough insight into scale/scope that it can be gauged be Melissa and myself
- a general sense of how the various technical requirements will be met

Please feel free to reach out with any questions!
